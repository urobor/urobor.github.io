My adventure with writing YouTube video downloading plugins
came to an end. After some serious struggling I have decided
not to add functionality and not to publish add-on at all.

Final shape of supported features is shown on the diagram
beneath. Actually program has became rather an YouTube
video marker as download function was removed.

"Design - function invoked on every possible event occurrence")

Summing up Addon-SDK is wery well documented. It maybe
lacks some decent examples base but honestly after a month
of writing code I really did not miss that.

Recently I've found komodo editor which has built-in support
for developing Firefox extensions. So mayby some day I will
give it a try.
