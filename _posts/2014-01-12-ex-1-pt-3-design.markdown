According to previous post, today I should write something about:

- using addon properties (paths representing download dir and data file)
- checking if given directory exists
- checking if give file exists and reading its content line by line

but the concept changed a little bit and now addon would just mark videos 
to download. 

Recently (actually couple of months ago) I found a cli 
program that deals with downloading videos from youtube. It is written
in python and as an input it needs the url of the video and optionally 
an itag - which by the way will suits our need. As the mentioned program is
under heavy development and up to date I will skip the implementation 
of 'download' functionality in my addon.

Today instead of source code I will post and overall design. What is
the desired functionality of addon being developed.

Sticking to the KISS principle, I shall implenent only necessery
functionality and as easy and straight forward ass possible.

![Design image](/img/ex-1-pt-2-activity-diagram-1.png "Design - function invoked on every possible event occurrence")

As showne above addon will be mainly about marking the videos to download.
Not actually downloading them. 

Events that invokes function showed on picture above will be:

- tab switch/change, new tab, overall change focus of displayed tab,
- page relod, new page, content and overall url change.

So summing up function should be executed on every url change of tab currently being displayed.
