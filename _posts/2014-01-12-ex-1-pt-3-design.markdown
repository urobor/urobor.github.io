According to previous post, today I should write something about:

- using add-on properties (paths representing download dir and data file)
- checking if given directory exists
- checking if given file exists and reading its content line by line

but the concept changed a little bit and now add-on would just mark videos 
to download. 

Recently (actually couple of months ago) I found a cli 
program that deals with downloading videos from YouTube. It is written
in python and as an input it needs the URL of the video and optionally 
an itag - which by the way will suits our need. As the mentioned program is
under heavy development and up to date I will skip the implementation 
of 'download' functionality in my add-on.

Today instead of source code I will post and overall design. What is
the desired functionality of add-on being developed.

Sticking to the KISS principle, I shall implement only necessary
functionality and as easy and straight forward ass possible.

![Design image](/img/ex-1-pt-2-activity-diagram-1.png
"Design - function invoked on every possible event occurrence")

As shown above add-on will be mainly about marking the videos to download.
Not actually downloading them. 

Events that invokes function showed on picture above will be:

- tab switch/change, new tab, overall change focus of displayed tab,
- page reload, new page, content and overall URL change.

So summing up function should be executed on every URL change of tab
currently being displayed.
